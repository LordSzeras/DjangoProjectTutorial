This project is for me to run through the Django tutorial.

Eventually I will be using this knowledge to create a database that can be queried to search through 3D printing stls from
  some of my favorite creators.  Hopefully I can share it with those creators as a way to help anyone else using the files to
  more effectively search and find the right stl for their printing needs.
